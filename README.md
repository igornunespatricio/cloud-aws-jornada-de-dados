# cloud-aws-jornada-de-dados

Repository containing labs, examples, and study notes from my AWS cloud learning journey — covering core services, architecture basics, and data engineering workflows.

## 📁 Project Structure

This repository is organized by classes, with each class folder containing hands-on labs, code examples, configuration files, and study materials for specific AWS topics.

Each class directory (class01, class02, class03, etc.) represents a specific learning module and contains:

- **README.md** - Detailed documentation for the class including objectives, steps, and learnings
- **Code examples** - Practical implementations of AWS services
- **Configuration files** - IAM policies, CloudFormation templates, and other AWS configurations
- **Study notes** - Key concepts and observations from the learning material
